Description
===========
This project is based on the Capistrano Bells project by Pat Nakajima, but has been edited to better suit my deployment environments.



TODO
====
1. TESTS!
2. Add recipes for God
3. Modularize everything to make it less config file-ish and more object oriented.


=== About

Capistrano Bells is a collection of recipes intended to make deploying
Rails apps easier. That's it and that's all.
